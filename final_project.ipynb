    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sourced from Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These analysis used a complete data from their most recent animal study in two datasets in CSV format. Data set one is Mouse_metadata.csv wich includes 249 mice identified data with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens, and their Sex, Age_months and Weight (g) identified. The other dataset is Study_results.csv file which includes the results of the study in each columns Mouse I,Timepoint,Tumor Volume (mm3), and Metastatic Sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.. For this analysis both datasets imported, merged,cleaned and the aggregate data diplayed in to Python Pandas dataframes, visualized in Matplotlib, and other libraries used in order to make a stastical analysis.\n"

    "Instructions\n",
    "Your tasks are to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before beginning the analysis, you have two datasets combine them together to create one dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "2. check the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the cleaned data for the remaining steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. enerate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using Matplotlib, generate a box plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: All four box plots should be within the same figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook."
